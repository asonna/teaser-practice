      <p>Freida Pinto (born 18 October 1984)<span class="hidden">is an Indian actress who has appeared mainly in American and British films. Born and raised in Mumbai, she decided to become an actress at a young age. She was educated at St. Xavier's College, Mumbai, where she took part in amateur plays. After graduation, she briefly worked as a model and then as a television presenter. Pinto made her cinematic debut with the British drama Slumdog Millionaire (2008), for which she received several nominations at the British Academy Film Awards, the MTV Movie Awards and the Teen Choice Awards. Her biggest commercial success came with the 2011 science fiction film Rise of the Planet of the Apes. The same year, she portrayed the title character in Michael Winterbottom's Trishna. Her performance in the biographical film Desert Dancer (2014) received critical acclaim. Although the Indian media has credited Pinto with breaking stereotypes of Indian women in foreign films, she has been a lesser-known figure in Indian cinema. She is a vocal advocate for underprivileged children and women.</span>
